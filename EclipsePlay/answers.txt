1. What does File -> Revert do?
	A: It changes back the indentation to how it was before we fixed it. Revert will undo the last thing we changed. 
	
2. Describe what happens when you walk through the loop in showPeople in the debug mode?
	A: It loops through the friends array list to print out every object. When it prints, it goes to our toString method to get the information we want to print. 
	
3. What do you notice when you comment out the toString function of the Friend class?
	A: It prints out the type of object and then the memory location of the object rather than the name and email.
